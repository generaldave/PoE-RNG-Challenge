Path of Exile RNG Challenge

App randomly generates a new character setup. It is themed to the Path of Exile forums.

If user wants a new setup generated, he or she has to re-open or refresh the page. I didn't include a button to do so because the player isn't meant to.

The app randomizes class, ascendancy, defense type, offense skill type, and weapon type.

The user can choose which skill gem to use within the category given. The same idea applies to weapon type.
